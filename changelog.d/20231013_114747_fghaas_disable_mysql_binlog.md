[Bugfix] Default to running MySQL 8 in a standalone configuration without [binary logging](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/binary-log.html), as we did in Tutor 15 with MySQL 5.7. If you do need binary logging because you are running [MySQL replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication.html), or you want to be able to do [point-in-time recovery using the binlog](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/point-in-time-recovery-binlog.html), set `MYSQL_ENABLE_BINLOG: true` in `config.yml`.
